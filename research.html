                    <p><strong>Ever Wondered</strong> Why Human Beings are able to walk in such a symmetric manner?
                    <strong>Does There Exists a central pattern generator </strong> that is responsible for symmetric walking?
                    And If there does exist a central pattern generator can we somehow use it to improve the gait in post stroke patients?
                    Several researchers have pondered over this question and the answer they reached was <strong>ENTRAINMENT</strong></p><br>

                    <p>The concept of achieving entrainment using robots is not new.
                    However, the robots used for exploring entrainment were large rigid robot with huge inertial component associated with them.
                    We used a soft robotic approach to explore entrainment. The type of soft robot we used are known as <strong>ff-PAMs</strong></p>
